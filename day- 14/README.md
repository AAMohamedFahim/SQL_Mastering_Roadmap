## ðŸ“– Overview
Set operations allow you to combine results from multiple queries. They enable comparisons and unions of different datasets â€” all while preserving or eliminating duplicates based on the operation used.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Understand how to combine results using SQL set operations
- Differentiate between `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`
- Learn about handling duplicates and column compatibility
- Master ordering and chaining of multiple operations

## ðŸ§© Set Operation Topics

### 1. Introduction to Set Operations in SQL
Set operations combine results from two or more queries. Each query must return the same number and type of columns.

### 2. UNION vs. UNION ALL

```sql
-- UNION: Removes duplicates
SELECT city FROM customers
UNION
SELECT city FROM suppliers;

-- UNION ALL: Keeps duplicate
SELECT city FROM customers
UNION ALL
SELECT city FROM suppliers;
